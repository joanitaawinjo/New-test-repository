    <p style="border:2px solid;">My first week at AkiraChix was an amazing one. On reaching the campus,wow the environment was just attractive to the eyes, the warm welcome from the allumnais was just enough for me to feel at home and at peace. The meals were and are just amazing, everything I would think of as a need at school was available. What a happy life!!!. We had to rest for the whole week since we were tired from the long journey from our contries. The administration was so friendly giving peace at mind. In a nutshell, the week was fantastic.</
